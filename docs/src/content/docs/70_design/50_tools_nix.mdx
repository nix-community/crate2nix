The `tools.nix` file contain the necessary code to generate the `Cargo.nix` file
during evaluation time, which guarantee to always have `Cargo.nix` file up-to-date
in regard to the `Cargo.lock`. The generated file is imported automatically in Nix
code via the [import from derivation feature](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/import-from-derivation),
and can then be used like a normal `Cargo.nix` file.

Internally, this work by reading the `Cargo.lock` file with Nix, using the locked
version and hash present in it to fetch them without introducing impurities.
The fetched dependencies are then used to generate a vendored folder, and the
appropriate configuration is generated so that the dependencies are fetched from here.
`crate2nix` is then called in a derivation that will generate the `Cargo.nix` file
offline, which can later be imported.
